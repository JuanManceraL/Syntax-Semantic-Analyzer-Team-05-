# Syntax and Semantic Analyzer
This project implements a syntax and semantic analyzer for a custom programming language. It parses input source code to ensure it follows syntactic and semantic rules and outputs relevant data for debugging and analysis.

# Features
Syntax Parsing: Verifies the structure of the code using a formal grammar.
Semantic Analysis: Ensures proper usage of identifiers, types, and operations.
Symbol Table Management: Tracks variables, functions, and their scopes.
Graphical User Interface (GUI):
  A menu with examples of correct and incorrect code is available for testing.
  Users can load these examples directly to evaluate the functionality of the analyzer.
Detailed Outputs:
  Advertisements: Displays all the advertisements generated by the code.
  Reduction Steps: Shows the sequence of grammar reductions.
  Symbol Table Updates: Logs changes to the symbol table.

#Setup and Execution
